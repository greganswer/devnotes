## Agile

Here is a list of brief and free courses on agile methodologies

### [Learn the truth about agile versus waterfall](https://www.udemy.com/learn-the-truth-about-agile-versus-waterfall/)

**Why I'm taking it:** I know Agile is better, but why is it better?

**Date completed:** Jun 15, 2017

**What I Learned:**

- It turns out that Agile is not necessarily better. Just different
- You don't need to use one or the other. They can be complementary
- The problem is that both approaches are often misapplied
- Waterfall can be inflexible and it does not include customer feedback
- Agile is a way of thinking that is more flexible, has testing built in, and generally has a faster time-to-market
- Scrum
    + Is a form of agile
    + **Empirical process -** both the process and the results are adjusted as needed based on observations (continuous improvement)
    + **Product Owner -** focuses on what is done
    + **Scrum Master -** focuses on how it is done
    + **Development Team -** cross functional, self organizing, and responsible for the solution 
    + The Product Backlog is continuously refined, prioritized, and clarified
- A hybrid creates different levels of agility
    - Start with a general idea
    - Engage a small test group as you progress
    - Work iteratively 

### [Basics of scrum, agile and project delivery](https://www.udemy.com/scrum-methodology/)

**Why I'm taking it:** I want to make sure that I'm focused on priorities no matter what project I'm working on.

### [A complete course on scrum body of knowledge](https://www.udemy.com/a-complete-course-on-scrum-body-of-knowledge-sbok-guide)

## General Web Development

### [Ux and web design master course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2)

**Why I'm taking it:** **This is the most important part about technology - the user experience**

### [The web development bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp)

**Why I'm taking it:** Just a refresher on most of the things I know so far.

## JavasScript

Here is where I'll be getting my hands dirty.

### [The complete javascript course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-javascript-course)

**Why I'm taking it:** The next few courses are going to be dependent on my understanding of this course.

### [Javascript: understanding the weird parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript)

**Why I'm taking it:** JavaScript can be really weird. I seek to understand it.

### [The complete Node.js developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-nodejs-developer-course-2)

**Why I'm taking it:** Because it allows me to use a single programming language, rather than rely on a different language for writing server side scripts.

### [Modern react with redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux)

**Why I'm taking it:** Because React is a fast, simple, scalable, in-demand open-source JavaScript library

## Miscellaneous

### [Decoding AP computer science a](https://www.udemy.com/decoding-ap-computer-science-a)

**Why I'm taking it:** To brush up on my Computer Science Knowledge that I may have neglected in high school.

### [Python for beginners with examples](https://www.udemy.com/ardit-sulce-python-for-beginners)

**Why I'm taking it:** A few jobs descriptions had "Knowledge of Python" and I want to get a brief overview of Python.
